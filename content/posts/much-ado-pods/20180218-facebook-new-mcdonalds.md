We recorded this podcast on February 10, 2018. Since then, Wired has published their scathing article on Facebook’s hellish two years, and Eminem has released a music video that heavily references the modern Facebook experience as the backdrop to the current social and political crises in USA. Hopefully we are not as critical, although I must say myself that we come close. Facebook, being near and dear to my heart as probably the company I have been the most intimate with, plays the representative for the entire social media scene of 2018 as Shan Singh and I dig deep into how it is impacting our society today and how it has impacted it in the years past.

This is the fourth part of the series. In this video I dig deeper into how inheritance and polymorphism works in Go. I do this by extending the linked list implementation from previous videos to create a new implementation that keeps elements sorted in their natural order.

In the next video, I will explore how concurrency works in Go by building and testing mechanisms to make our linked list implementations thread safe!

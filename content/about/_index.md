Welcome to my blog â€“ The BIT That Matters! My name is Saharsh Singh and I am a software engineer by profession. This site is a collection of blog posts and podcasts that touch on software development, technology, politics, pop culture, relationships, and whatever else I might be feeling passionate about at the moment. Since this blog, like my interests, is all over the place, use the tags when searching to focus your results. Hope you are able to get something out of this blog.
